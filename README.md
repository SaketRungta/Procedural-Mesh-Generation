This is my VizExperts interview task project, where I was required to do the following
1. Write a Blueprint to create a Geometry along the Catmull-ROM spline using a function implemented in C++
2. Do not use SplineMeshComponent use ProceduralMeshComponent to generate the extruded geometry
3. The Blueprint takes 3 inputs
    - List of Points from the a text file
- A Texture File in PNG/JPEG Format
- Width of Geometry to be Created
4. During Construction/Start of Game the blueprint should do the following
    - Generate a smooth geometry width (see attached image for reference)
- Apply specified texture
